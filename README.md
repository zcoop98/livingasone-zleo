## Living As One Programming Exercise

This project is a coding exercise done for the [Living As One](https://livingasone.com/) recruitment process.

### Original Project Parameters:
The exercise we’d like to see is to use the NASA API described [here](https://api.nasa.gov) to build a project in GitHub that calls the Mars Rover API and selects a picture on a given day. We want your application to download and store each image locally.

    * June 2, 2018
    * Jul-13-2016
    * April 31, 2018
* Language needs to be *Java*.
* We should be able to run and build (if applicable) locally after you submit it
* Include relevant documentation (.MD, etc.) in the repo

#### Bonus 
* Bonus - Unit Tests, Static Analysis, Performance tests or any other things you feel are important for Deﬁnition of Done
* Double Bonus - Have the app display the image in a web browser
* Triple Bonus – Have it run in a Docker or K8s (Preferable)
